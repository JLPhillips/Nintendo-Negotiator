# Sleeper Sell.

## Elevator Pitch

Got a pile of old video games stacking up? Wondering how much they'd be worth if you ever sold them? How much value they've lost over time? Now you can find out! 

## Project Requirements

  * Very simple functionality and feature set.
  * Ability to Create, Edit, Update, and Delete your titles, easily!
  * A few interesting SQL queries! Neato!

## Feature List:

  * Enter basic info about your game collection, including title, console, condition, and original purchase price!
  * See your entire collection of games and their current values at a glance!
  * Get a report of your most (or least) valuable games!
  * Query for the average/minimum/maximum value of your collection by specific console, year, or even developer!

## Interesting Query:

See which developers or series in your collection have the longest lasting value in different countries, regardless of condition!

## Data Source:

Game data from three different databases:
  * GiantBomb (http://www.giantbomb.com/api/)
  * TheGamesDB (https://github.com/TheGamesDB/TheGamesDB)
  * ProgrammableWeb (http://www.programmableweb.com/apitag/?apicat=Games&protocol=REST&q=video%20game)

I will be using an excerpt from my own collection as an example.
